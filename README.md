# Project Overview

This project aims to develop an interactive 3D model viewer using Three.js and React, capable of displaying one or multiple 3D models simultaneously. Users can interact with these models, selecting specific ones to load or unload. Additionally, the project features an AI chatbot integration (using Chat GPT) to assist users by answering their questions. The API key for the chatbot is securely managed through AWS Lambda and API Gateway (REST API).
